    Hello! , My name is Josiah i'm 16 and I attend <u>LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts and Music</u> as a junior. This website is basically all about me. I'm going to be taking about my life experiences and things I like and like todo. I'm going to be sharing some ups and downs of what its like for me as a student of this school and giving some advice or some things to know to any future LaGuardia Student!

  When I first found out about this school I was in my senior year of middle school (8th Grade) I knew I was a little different then how other people were in my old school. Most guys wanted to play beasketball or football and while those are fun I knew I liked the arts and wanted to laern more about what I can do.
  </p>

<p>
  Before Laguardia I had <strong>NO EXPERIANCE</strong> in my major at all. <mark>Laguardia has a lot of options/majors to pick from</mark>. You can be a:
<ol>
  <li>Instrumental Majorüéª</li>
  <li>Drama Majorüé≠</li>
  <li>Fine Arts Majorüé®</li>
  <li>Vocal Majorüé§</li>
  <li>Tech Majorüõ†Ô∏è</li>
  <li>Or a Dance Majorü©∞</li>
  </ol>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
  <li> Deals with Instruments like guitalr , strings , drums etc.Also deals with learning to read music</li>
   <li>Acting , monolauges, plays , movement etc.</li>
   <li>Drawing ,painting ,digital drawing.</li>
   <li>-Deals with learning how to use you voice in multiple genres, Mainly classical.Also deals with learning to read music</li>
   <li>Deals with learning how to buiild sets for school plays</li>
   <li>Advanced larning on dancing , african dancing, ballet etc.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  I'm a <em>vocal major</em> and I had no experiance what so ever of how to use my voice properly a , I just knew I wanted to perfect this craft. During my freshman year I was really shy and slacked in my voice class because I was afarid to sing. It was the biggest mistake of my time here , Not the being afraid part but not allowing my self to accept the experiance the school gives me. Due to this... I was behind so now that i'm a junior , sometimes I feem i'm singing at a level a sophmore should be. Even though I know what to do it's hard for me to do it because I unconcionsly refused training due to my fear.
</p>

<p>
  One big peice of advice is to allow yourself to take in the experiance. <mark>Fear will only set you back if you dont push through it</mark>. This really goes for anything if you want that job , house , lead role , 1st place do not let that fear hold you back.I'm still scared to this day as a junior to get infront of my voice class and sing , but not allowing my self to learn and face it will get me no where.
