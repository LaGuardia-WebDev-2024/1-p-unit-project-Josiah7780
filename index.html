  When I first found out about this school I was in my senior year of middle school (8th Grade) I knew I was a little different then how other people were in my old school. Most guys wanted to play beasketball or football and while those are fun I knew I liked the arts and wanted to laern more about what I can do.

  Before Laguardia I had <strong>NO EXPERIANCE</strong> in my major at all. <mark>Laguardia has a lot of options/majors to pick from</mark>. You can be a:

  <li>Drama Majorüé≠</li>
  <li>Fine Arts Majorüé®</li>
  <li>Vocal Majorüé§</li>
  <li>Tech Majorüõ†Ô∏è</li>
  <li>Or a Dance Majorü©∞</li>

  I'm a vocal major and I had no experiance what so ever of how to use my voice properly a , I just knew I wanted to perfect this craft. During my freshman year I was really shy and slacked in my voice class because I was afarid to sing. It was the biggest mistake of my time here , Not the being afraid part but not allowing my self to accept the experiance the school gives me. Due to this... I was behind so now that i'm a junior , i'm singing at a level a sophmore should be. Even though I know what to do it's hard for me to do it because i refused training due to my fear.
